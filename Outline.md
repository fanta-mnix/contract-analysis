## Introduction
The project's domain background — the field of research where the project is derived;

## Why
A problem statement — a problem being investigated for which a solution will be defined;

## Evidence
The datasets and inputs — data or inputs being used for the problem;

## What
A solution statement — a the solution proposed for the problem given;

## References
A benchmark model — some simple or historical model or result to compare the defined solution to;

## Methodology
A set of evaluation metrics — functional representations for how the solution can be measured;

## How
An outline of the project design — how the solution will be developed and results obtained.
